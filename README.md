# R-ALAB_316.3.1

# This is my lab which demonstrates DOM Manipulation 
# I was able to verify functionality for all deliverables and can confirm one error:
# The following deliverable "If the ABOUT link is clicked, an 'About' should be displayed." does not work as intended.
# Different solutions/work-arounds were pursued to no avail.
